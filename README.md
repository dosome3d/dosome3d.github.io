Welcome to my modest repo on GitHub. &mdash; Kelvin Thompson

This is a place for me to play around with some experiments in **3D** &amp; **WebGL** &amp; **ThreeJS**.

So far there's just one demo - a [pretty, interactive fountain](https://dosome3d.github.io/fountain.html).

Coming up: A representation of the [ever-changing matter of our bodies](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/02/science/your-body-is-younger-than-you-think.html).
